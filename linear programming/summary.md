### 1. the standard form
1.1 all constraints are equations  
1.2 the objective could be a maximization or minimization problem, both of them are fine.
1.3 the rank of a should be less than n (the number of variables). it means that more variables than constraints

### 2. Process
1.1 it's like we are exploring from one vertex to another vertex
1.2 so we need basic feasible solution, which is a basis
1.3 iterate the process, from one basis to another basis, during the process, improve the objective
