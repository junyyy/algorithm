Q1
1.1 feasibility
ignored the constraint [2], set no objectives
Results:
    Total demand is: 44
    Total supply is: 44.0
    Total pumping power is: 3484.9075701436304
        The pumping power is calculated by adding all power of each supply node.
        The power that each supply node consumes is calculated by constraint [2]


1.2.1
The simple bounds are only used in the relaxation of constraint [2], which is a non-linear constraint.
so that [2] can be relaxed into constraints [3] and [4].
Relaxation Objective 3127.3013499999997
Exact Objective 3415.9130187585342

1.2.2
Ignore the constraints [3] and [4]
change the objective to the min value of s, the result is:
min: 3.5210716, 9.3862895, 8.167482, 8.1455599, 3.5499084, they can be the new lower bounds of the variable

then maximize the objective, the result is:
max: 9.0, 11.0, 15.945724, 10.0, 6.9791667, they can be the new upper bounds of the variable
solve the problem, and get:
Relaxation Objective 3295.68598
Exact Objective 3415.9446709291433

Even the new exact objective is not better than previous one
the new relaxation objective becomes closer to the exact objective
it indicates that the tighter bounds of variable s can help to generate better relaxation of non-linear constraint
so the quality of tighter bounds is better than the simple bounds
